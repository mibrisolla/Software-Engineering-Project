Our app is going to be a revamped version of the popular AirBuds app.  The preexisting AirBuds app has a lot of features, such as adding friends, sending reactions to songs, viewing listening history, leaderboards for artists, and so on.  
In our version, we plan to add the ability to:
    - Share songs directly with other users
    - Show podcast listening history, as well as adding leaderboards to that as well. (i.e. "You're among the top 5 listeners of [insert podcast name]" 
    - Link social medias such as Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, so on
    - Link to other music apps such as Bandcamp, Tidal, etc
    - Showcase favorite podcasts in the same way you can showcase favorite artists or songs
    - Expand reactions beyond emojis, such as using GIFs
    - (Potentially) Add weekly challenges that can help add more features to your account instead of having to add friends to unlock them
